# Stanford Code in Place - Final Project (The WordGuess game) 

This is one of several final project ideas. You can implement any of the final project ideas, or you can come up with your own. 

When the user plays WordGuess, the computer first selects a secret word at random from a list built into the program. The program then prints out a row of dashesâ€”one for each letter in the secret word and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the user has made eight incorrect guesses. Two sample runs of the game are shown below (user input is shown in italics).

let's start...............

To make this project you need to follow this step:-

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash


"""
The WordGuess game where the player tries to guess a secret word by providing letter guesses.
"""

import random

LEXICON_FILE = "Lexicon.txt"    # File to read word list from
INITIAL_GUESSES = 8             # Max number of guesses per game

    """
    guessed_word = ['-'] * len(secret_word)
    guesses_left = INITIAL_GUESSES

    while True:

        print('You have', guesses_left, 'guesses left')
        guess = input('Type a single letter here, then press enter: ').upper()

        if len(guess) != 1:
            print('Guess should only be a single character.')
            continue

            break


def get_word():
    """

    with open(LEXICON_FILE, 'r') as file:
